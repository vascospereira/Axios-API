# Axios
Axios is a Promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript which can be used in your front-end application and in your Node.js backend. By using Axios it's easy to send asynchronous HTTP request to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations. The Axios library can be used in your plain JavaScript application.

This is an example of using axios to get JSON data, an Image file, some text, deal with a HEAD request, GET request and a POST request.
